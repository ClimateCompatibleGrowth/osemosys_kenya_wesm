Whole energy system model
=========================

The Kenya Whole Energy System Model (WESM) is a linear optimization model of the entire Kenyan energy system, developed in OSeMOSYS. The model contains a detailed description of the power sector, based on a previously developed power sector-specific model, as well as all other major sectors driving energy demand in Kenya, namely agriculture, industry, transports, and the commercial and residential sectors.

This documentation should help users navigate through the model and understand the rationale and hypothesis behind it, and it is structured as follows.
