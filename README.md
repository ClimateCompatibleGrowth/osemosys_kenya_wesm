# OSeMOSYS Kenya Whole Energy System Model

This repository houses the OSeMOSYS Kenya Whole Energy System Model (WESM), developed within the Climate Compatible Growth (CCG) Project. The model describes the entire ener Kenyan energy system, including the agricultural, commercial, industrial, residential and transport sectors. In the current version, no storage technologies are included. The data file was generated through OSeMOSYS' [user interface](https://github.com/ClimateCompatibleGrowth/OSEMOSYS_UI) developed by UNDESA, version 4.5, and the model file is the one embedded in the same version of the UI.
